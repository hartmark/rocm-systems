// Communicator-level MPI tests for the GIN <-> NIC fusion interaction: fusing
// NICs into vNICs (NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS plus NCCL_NET_FORCE_MERGE or
// NCCL_NET_MERGE_LEVEL) must not take GIN or the host RMA proxy away from the
// communicator.
//
// These are deliberately not device-GIN tests. A gin.put() kernel needs a
// symmetric window, so it needs NCCL_CUMEM_ENABLE, which is unavailable on
// architectures where cuMem does not auto-enable. The capability derivation
// guarded here runs on every architecture, so keeping the tests off the
// symmetric-memory path is what makes them runnable at all on most clusters.
