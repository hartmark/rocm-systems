/// @brief A minimal vfio-user client, for driving the transport in tests.
///
/// @details The transport is the part of the PCI front end that a unit test
/// cannot reach by calling a device directly: everything interesting about it
/// happens in response to protocol messages from a VMM. Booting a guest to
/// produce those messages takes a minute and cannot easily provoke the cases
/// worth testing, such as a client that shares memory the transport must
/// decline, so this client speaks the protocol directly.
///
/// It implements only the framing and the handful of messages the tests need,
/// and deliberately uses nothing but the public wire definitions: a test that
/// depended on the library's internal transport helpers would break when they
/// change, which is exactly the sort of coupling tests should not add.
